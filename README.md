<h1 align="center"> Welcome to Pynnovators! </h1>

We’re a community of tech innovators learning Python—from fundamentals to advanced topics and real-world frameworks. Code along, build cool projects, and grow together.

## What This Repo Is For

This repository serves as a **daily learning log**.
Each day you’ll find:

- Assigned issues or tasks
- Their solutions
- Short explanations of the approach
- Notes on improvements or alternative ideas

This is **not** a full Python course — it’s a practical, problem-focused learning journal.
